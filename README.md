Smart electricity controller using face detection
An idea of saving energy which can help in reducing the effect of Global 
Warming:-

As we all know that these days Global Warming are increasing rapidly which is a very dangerous sign 
for the all human beings, not only human being but for the whole earth. So it is very serious topic of 
concern and by keeping this in our mind we the members of “Team Aryabhatta” going to build an AI 
system which may help us in saving the energy from wastage.
It is often seen that we always forget to switch off lights and fan of our room, when we are leaving the 
room, so we are going to build an AI system which can detect the face in the room and if there will no 
one in the room the it will automatically switch off all lights and fan of the room. By this wastage of 
energy can be reduced which is indirectly related to the Global Warming.


Problem Statement:-
Build an AI system which can automatically switch off the lights and fans or other electrical devices of 
the room, when we leave the room or when the system find no any faces (face detection) in the room.
In this project we will use:-


Software:-
 IDE: - Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda)
 Programming Language: - Python3
 For GUI interface we have used tKinter(Python)
 For face detection: - OpenCV (Computer Vision)
 Machine Learning using Python (computer vision)
 Dataset to train the model: - Face Detection in Images | Kaggle + Personal images


Hardware:-
 Camera (Web camera) for face detection.
 Raspberry pi model 2
 Flex cable
 Bulb (light bulb)
 One Laptop/or PC
 Sensor
 USB cable
